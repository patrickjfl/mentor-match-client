This is a [platform](https://mentor-match.netlify.app/) to help School of Code bootcampers to find a suitable mentor working in tech to support them.  It allows mentors to register and submit information about their professional interests, hobbies etc, which bootcampers can then view before submitting five preferred mentors (with some guidance from Chris Meah).
